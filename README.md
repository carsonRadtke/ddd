# C++ Ray Caster

## A simple ray caster.


### Getting Started
Build:
```shell
$ make -j
```

Run:
```shell
$ bin/ddd > file.ppm
```

Will render the scene to a ppm file. Then you can open the file.

### TODO
 - [ ] ray caster -> ray tracer for finer images
 - [ ] configuration files so scene can be changed without recompiling
 - [ ] different image output formats for more portability
